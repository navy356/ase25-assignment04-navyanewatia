# Non-Functional Requirements
- As a customer, I want the platform to be responsive and lightweight so that I can browse easily and without delays.
- As a customer, I want the platform to be intuitive to use so that I can order ingredients without confusion or frustration.
- As a registered customer, I want the platform to not lose order details if the system crashes so my orders remain accurate and trustworthy.
