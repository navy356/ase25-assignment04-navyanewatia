# Adressing the selected NFR
**As a developer, I want the platform to be easy to maintain and extend with new meal types or dietary rules so that the platform can evolve with changing requirements.**
## Assumptions
- The implementation uses MealDB as a class to store meal data. For the prototype it is simply stored in a list but in a proper application it would be replaced with a database. MealDB mimics such a database.
