# Selected Requirements for the Prototype
## Functional
As a customer, I want to search meals by name, ingredient, or category (e.g., vegan, quick meals, gluten-free) so that I can easily find meals that meet my preferences.
### Why is this a reasonable scope for the prototype?
This requirement directly impacts the customer experience, as searching for meals is one of the first interactions a customer has with SmartCater. Being able to quickly find meals that meet their preferences ensures that customers can efficiently select and order meals, improving satisfaction and reducing the likelihood that they turn to competitors. 
### Why select this functional requirment?
We selected this functional requirement for the prototype because it is core to the platform and can be effectively demonstrated with sample data.
## Non-Functional
As a developer, I want the platform to be easy to maintain and extend with new meal types or dietary rules so that the platform can evolve with changing requirements.
### Why select this non-functional requirement?
This requirement ensures that SmartCater can continue to meet evolving customer needs and market trends without disrupting existing functionality. By designing the system to be extensible, new meals or dietary rules can be added efficiently, supporting the platform’s growth and long-term sustainability. 
We selected this non-functional requirement for the prototype because it demonstrates a flexible architecture that will reliably accommodate future changes.
