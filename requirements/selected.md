# Selected Requirements for the Prototype
## Functional
As a customer, I want to search meals by name, ingredient, or category (e.g., vegan, quick meals, gluten-free) so that I can easily find meals that meet my preferences.
### Why?
This requirement is one of the first features the customer will interact with and therefore important to create a strong impression on the customer. We want the customer to easily find what they are looking for based on their preferences. After all, they have to find and select a meal first to proceed to order.
## Non-Functional
As a developer, I want the platform to be easy to maintain and extend with new meal types or dietary rules so that the platform can evolve with changing requirements.
### Why?
This requirement ensures SmartCater can adapt to future changes without major modifications to existing code.
