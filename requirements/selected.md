# Selected Requirements for the Prototype
## Functional
As a customer, I want to search meals by name, ingredient, or category (e.g., vegan, quick meals, gluten-free) so that I can easily find meals that meet my preferences.
### Why is this a reasonable scope for the prototype?
This requirement directly impacts the customer experience, as searching for meals is one of the first interactions a customer has with SmartCater. Being able to quickly find meals that meet their preferences ensures that customers can efficiently select and order meals, improving satisfaction and reducing the likelihood that they turn to competitors. 
### Why select this functional requirment?
We selected this functional requirement for the prototype because it is core to the platform and can be effectively demonstrated with sample data.
## Non-Functional
As a developer, I want the platform to be easy to maintain and extend with new meal types or dietary rules so that the platform can evolve with changing requirements.
### Why select this non-functional requirement?
We selected this non-functional requirement for the prototype because it can be clearly demonstrated on a small scale while showing its impact on the system’s long-term value. Even in a prototype using in-memory data, we can illustrate that new meals, categories, or dietary rules can be added without changing existing functionality, proving that the platform is designed to evolve reliably as customer needs and market trends change. This helps stakeholders understand that the system architecture supports growth and flexibility from the very beginning.
