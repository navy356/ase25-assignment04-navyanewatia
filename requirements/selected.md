# Selected Requirements for the Prototype
## Functional
As a customer, I want to search meals by name, ingredient, or category (e.g., vegan, quick meals, gluten-free) so that I can easily find meals that meet my preferences.
### Why is this a reasonable scope for the prototype?
This requirement directly impacts the customer experience, as searching for meals is one of the first interactions a customer has with SmartCater. Being able to quickly find meals that meet their preferences ensures that customers can efficiently select and order meals, improving satisfaction and reducing the likelihood that they turn to competitors. 
### Why select this functional requirment?
We selected this functional requirement for the prototype because searching meals is a core part of the customer experience and directly demonstrates the value of SmartCater. It can be effectively demonstrated using sample data, allowing stakeholders to see how customers can find meals by name, ingredient, or category. This makes it feasible to implement in a small-scale prototype while still clearly showing the feature’s impact on usability and customer satisfaction.

## Non-Functional
As a developer, I want the platform to be easy to maintain and extend with new meal types or dietary rules so that the platform can evolve with changing requirements.
### Why select this non-functional requirement?
We selected this non-functional requirement for the prototype because it can be clearly demonstrated on a small scale while showing its impact on the system’s long-term value. Even in a prototype using in-memory data, we can illustrate that new meals, categories, or dietary rules can be added without changing existing functionality, proving that the platform is designed to evolve reliably as customer needs and market trends change. This helps stakeholders understand that the system architecture supports growth and flexibility from the very beginning.
## How they relate
As more meal types or dietary preferences are added to the SmartCater, the customer should also be able to find them out of all the available ones.
